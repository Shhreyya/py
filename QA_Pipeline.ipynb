If you're looking for a Question Answering tutorial that uses a DocumentStore such as Elasticsearch, go to our new [Build a Scalable Question Answering System](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/03_scalable_qa_system) tutorial.\n",

        "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you will have learned about the Reader and Retriever, and built a question answering pipeline that can answer questions about the Game of Thrones series.\n"

        "Learn how to build a question answering system using Haystack's DocumentStore, Retriever, and Reader. Your system will use Game of Thrones files and will be able to answer questions like \"Who is the father of Arya Stark?\". But you can use it to run on any other set of documents, such as your company's internal wikis or a collection of financial reports. \n",

        "To help you get started quicker, we simplified certain steps in this tutorial. For example, Document preparation and pipeline initialization are handled by ready-made classes that replace lines of initialization code. But don't worry! This doesn't affect how well the question answering system performs."

A DocumentStore stores the Documents that the question answering system uses to find answers to your questions. In this tutorial, we're using the `InMemoryDocumentStore`, which is the simplest DocumentStore to get started with. It requires no external dependencies and it's a good option for smaller projects and debugging. But it doesn't scale up so well to larger Document collections, so it's not a good choice for production systems. To learn more about the DocumentStore and the different types of external databases that we support, see [DocumentStore](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/document_store).\n",

An early suggestion was to use animated maps as a transition between scenes to orient viewers, but that idea was dropped as it would interrupt the narrative flow. The idea of the map was therefore moved into the title sequence.  For the original pilot, the showrunners Benioff and Weiss initially wrote the title sequence as a crow's flight from King's Landing to Winterfell;  however, the production team at Elastic thought the idea was too flat and devised the idea of using 3-D models within a sphere that represents the world of the show.

It is also noteworthy that the appearance of Winterfell has changed over the seasons: in Seasons 3 and 4 Winterfell was covered in smoke, referencing its burning at the end of Season 2, and in Season 5 the smoke was removed but the Bolton sigil replaced the Stark sigil, reflecting how the Boltons moved to Winterfell during that season. In episode 6.10, the Stark sigil returned, the result of Jon Snow and Sansa Stark's reclaiming Winterfell from the Boltons at the end of the previous episode.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 8}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '55f7f13db2cd3b84de3b3ce2d0d0b776'}>,\n",

He worked principally on the revival of ''The Twilight Zone'' throughout 1986 and on ''Beauty and the Beast'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R.

Later after the events of the \"Red Wedding\", Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother\\'s head. His uncle Tyrion and his grandfather Tywin are outraged and the former threatens Joffrey once again. After another disagreement, Tywin sends Joffrey to his room, much to Joffrey\\'s chagrin. During his wedding feast, he repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, presenting an offensive play about \"The War of the Five Kings\", with each of the kings played by dwarves to humiliate his uncle, whom he also forces to act as his cupbearer. At the conclusion of the dinner, however, Joffrey dies from poisoned wine.

Joffrey frequently orders his Kingsguard to beat Sansa. His cruelty and ignorance of the commoners' suffering makes him unpopular after he orders the City Watch to kill all of his father's bastard children in King's Landing; consequently, he is almost killed during a riot. When Stannis attacks King's Landing, Joffrey serves only as a figurehead and avoids the heavy fighting. When the battle eventually turns in Stannis' favor, Cersei calls her son into the safety of the castle, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion and grandfather Tywin, aided by the forces of House Tyrell.
